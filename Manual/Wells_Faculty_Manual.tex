When the policies and procedures in this manual differ from the AAUP guidelines, those of this \facman~ shall apply.

\subsubsection{Professional Responsibility}

All members of the Faculty shall have full freedom of inquiry; of instruction subject to the educational plans of the Faculty and of their respective divisions; and of expression of opinion.

\subsection{Teaching Faculty}\label{sec:TeachingFaculty}
The teaching Faculty of Wells College shall consist of two components: Tenured and Tenure-Track, and Non-Tenure Track.

Faculty shall be appointed to one of the following ranks.

\paragraph{Lecturer}
The rank of Lecturer normally shall be given to non-tenure-track Faculty members who do not hold the doctorate or the appropriate terminal degree. See also \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}, \cref{sec:AcademicRanks}.\labelcref{par:AppointmentAtTheRankOfVisitingProfessor}.

\paragraph{Instructor}
An initial appointment at the rank of Instructor shall normally be for two years and is given to tenure-track Faculty who do not yet hold the doctorate or appropriate terminal degree in the field. Upon completion of the degree the individual shall inform the Dean, who may then change immediately the individual's rank to Assistant Professor.

\subsubsection{Appointment at the Rank of Visiting Assistant Professor}\label{par:AppointmentAtTheRankOfVisitingProfessor}
Non-tenure-track Faculty members who hold the doctorate or the appropriate terminal degree may be appointed to the rank of Visiting Assistant Professor. The ranks of Visiting Associate Professor or Visiting Professor may be given to non-tenure-track Faculty members who hold those respective ranks at an accredited institution.

\subsubsection{Shared Positions}
Shared Positions have been removed from the manual. Shared positions that were in effect at the time of this deletion remain in effect.

Faculty appointments, reappointments, and appointments with tenure shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this \namecref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}. The expectation shall be that only the highest quality tenure-track Faculty shall be reappointed and ultimately awarded tenure.

For an initial appointment, the desirable characteristics of a candidate are excellence in teaching and scholarship, and the personal qualities that promise to make for a responsible and effective colleague.

For reappointment, promotion, and tenure, the emphasis of the evaluation shall be on teaching excellence, scholarly competence and activity, and contributions to the college community (e.g. in committees, in academic advising, in major field and divisional affairs, and in co-curricular activities).

\subsubsection{Tenured and Tenure-Track Faculty}\label{sub:TenuredAndTenureTrackFaculty}

\paragraph{Initial Tenure-Track Appointments}\label{par:InitialTenureTrackAppointments}

	\item Before offering the contract, the Dean of the College shall consult with the Advisory Committee on the years of prior service to be counted toward the years of probationary service and also the placement on the salary scale. Beginning with appointment to a tenure-track position, the probationary period shall not exceed seven years, including within this period full-time teaching in all institutions of higher education; except that, after a term of full-time service of more than three years at another institution, it may be agreed in writing that appointment is for a probationary period of not more than four years.
	\item The Dean shall provide the candidate with a written statement of the current status of the tenure policies at the College and the years of experience to be counted toward the years of probationary service.
	\item Initial tenure-track appointments shall ordinarily be for two years.
	\item The decision to designate a position as tenure-track shall be made before hiring, not at the time of an interim reappointment or at the time of the tenure decision. However, the identification of a position as tenure-track does not imply that the individual appointed to that position shall qualify for tenure, but rather that the individual is eligible for consideration for tenure.

	\item Following receipt of the recommendations of the Dean and the Advisory Committee, the President shall confer with the Dean and the Advisory Committee.

If the Review Committee determines that the Faculty member has shown good cause, it shall conduct a confidential review. The Committee shall submit its opinion and the record of the hearing to the Advisory Committee and the Dean and President in all cases and also to the Trustees on tenure cases.
	\item Since the re-appointment of a Faculty member shall not be refused on grounds that violate academic freedom (\cref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}, \cref{sec:TenureProfessionalResponsibilityAndAcademicFreedom}.\labelcref{sub:AcademicFreedom}), Faculty members who allege that their re-appointment has been refused on such grounds shall have the right to petition the Faculty for a hearing. Such a petition shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Faculty and shall be read at the ensuing meeting of the Faculty. If the Faculty decides that the petition demonstrates sufficient grounds for such a hearing, it shall elect a five-member committee according to the provision of \cref{art:FacultyAndGovernance}, \cref{sec:CommitteeService}.\labelcref{sub:Elections}. The committee shall conduct a hearing according to the provisions of \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}, \cref{sec:Dismissal}. The Committee shall submit its opinion and the record of the hearing to the President and to the Trustees.
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Review of Tenured Faculty}\label{par:ReviewOfTenuredFaculty}
The Advisory Committee shall review the performance of each tenured Faculty member at least once every seven years after the granting of tenure. The results of this review shall be conveyed in writing to the Faculty member and the Dean of the College. The criteria to be applied on such reviews shall be the same as those applied to Faculty being considered for appointment, reappointment, promotion, and tenure (see introduction to \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}, \cref{sec:AppointmentReappointmentPromotionAndTenure}). In the event the Faculty member's performance is not satisfactory, and there is a failure to improve over a four-year period, during which time there are at least two additional evaluations by the Advisory Committee, disciplinary proceedings for academic cause (as provided in \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}, \cref{sec:Dismissal}) or other appropriate measures shall be initiated by the Advisory Committee.

	\item The Advisory Committee shall review the performance of non-tenure-track Faculty members who are serving in their fourth semester at Wells College. Further reviews shall take place after each additional eight semesters of teaching. The criteria to be applied in such reviews shall be the same as those applied in other Faculty reviews, but with an emphasis on the three categories (teaching, scholarship, and community service) proportional to the nature of the position, and the procedures shall parallel those used in the seven-year evaluation of tenured Faculty members (see \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningFacultyStatus}, \cref{sec:AppointmentReappointmentPromotionAndTenure}.\labelcref{sub:TenuredAndTenureTrackFaculty}.\labelcref{par:ReviewOfTenuredFaculty}).

\subsection{Regulation of Studies}\label{sec:RegulationOfStudies}

\subsubsection{Choice of Studies}\label{sub:ChoiceOfStudies}

\paragraph{Responsibility}

Students shall be held responsible for fulfilling the requirements for the degree.

\paragraph{Declaration of Major or Minor}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item At any time after elevation to sophomore standing, but no later than March 1 in the sophomore year, students shall declare a major.
	\item To be eligible to declare the major, students must have a GPA of 2.0 in course work in the proposed major. If fewer than 6 semester hours in the proposed major have been completed, students may petition for provisional approval contingent on a GPA of 2.0 in course work in the proposed major at the end of the sophomore year. Transfer students with junior standing shall declare a major by the end of the first semester; formal admission into the major requires the written approval of a Wells College Faculty member in the major based on evaluation of the transfer record.
	\item Students are not normally encouraged to elect double majors. For students who feel  that their plans necessitate a double major rather than a major and a minor,  a Double Major Proposal form shall be filed with the Registrar no later than the end of advising week of the first semester of the junior year. This Proposal must indicate how the proposed plan of study meets the College's goals for a sound liberal arts program, including courses that satisfy the Core Requirements. The Proposal must be approved by an advisor from each major. Students must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.5 at the time of the proposal. A double major may not include an individualized major. Final approval rests with the Academic Standing and Advising Committee.
	\item Students desiring a minor shall declare the minor on a Declaration of Minor form, available in the Registrar's office or online, no later than the last day of classes of the first semester of the senior year.

The Individualized Major Proposal, available through the Registrar's office, provides a checklist of requirements. The IM is a possibility for students whose educational objectives  would be better served by an IM than by pursuing one of the established majors at Wells College or by pursuing an established major and minor.  
	\item Individualized Majors shall meet the philosophical and educational goals of Wells College and shall afford the students maximum exposure to the breadth and depth of a liberal education as well as an opportunity to undertake advanced work in an area of special interest.  
	\item The Individualized Major shall have a clear focus and shall substantially represent at least two disciplines. 
	\item The Academic Standing and Advising Committee shall approve or reject all Individualized Majors.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Independent Study, Tutorials and Experiential Learning}\label{sec:IndependentStudyAndTutorials}

\subsubsection{Independent Study}

\paragraph{Purpose}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Independent Study is an option for those students who have demonstrated an ability to work without close supervision. 
	\item The purpose of Independent Study is to supplement the more structured methods of regular courses with the opportunity for students of high initiative and responsibility to apply their abilities to new material with a minimum of guidance. 
	\item While there are no formal course prerequisites for such work, it is the normal expectation that independent projects shall involve explorations in depth of some prior work, or work for which the students have special non-academic background that qualifies them for the study proposed. Exceptions may be made in cases where students of generally demonstrated capability wish to do exploratory work in a field in which they have little or no background, in a manner not provided for by the regular curriculum. 
	\item Independent study normally is conducted at the 300 level as XXX 399 and may be for one to three semester hours of credit. Under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the instructor, preferably in the summer or the January Intersession, students may undertake independent study with the designation XXX 199 or XXX 299, to indicate that the work is not at a level sufficiently advanced to warrant a 300-level designation.
	\item In cases of irreconcilable schedule conflicts, a course from the regular curriculum may be taken as an independent study, either with the designation, 199/299/399, or with the regular course number, followed by ``I'', at the discretion of the instructor.
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Approval}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Qualified Sophomores, Juniors or Seniors may pursue one Independent Study Project during any semester. Exceptionally able and responsible students may pursue such work outside the academic semester. Under exceptional circumstances first year students may be permitted by petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and Advising to pursue an Independent Study Project after their first semester, either over January or in the Spring Semester.
	\item Students who have a plan for Independent Study should consult with the instructor under whose guidance the work is proposed. If the instructor approves the project, a brief description of the project and the amount of credit proposed for it, approved by the instructor and advisor, must be submitted on the Independent Study Form available through the Registrar's Office during the registration period preceding the semester in which the work is to be conducted. 
	\item Final approval of all projects rests with the Academic Standing and Advising Committee; copies of the proposal shall be distributed to the instructor, advisor, and student upon approval or disapproval. Students should not assume approval until formally so notified.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tutorials}

\paragraph{Purpose}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Tutorials offer a means for in-depth study of material or a topic not otherwise covered in the curriculum.  
	\item Tutorials are normally for one semester hour and normally involve a small group of students meeting together with a Faculty member for one hour per week.  Tutorials thus offer a flexible mechanism for providing instruction on topics that may arise via student request, to meet special or last minute curricular needs, and/or for skill development (such as in the performing arts).                                                                                                                     
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Approval }

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item In the case where a tutorial is offered for the first time, the instructor shall submit a Tutorial Proposal Form that shall include a description of the course, a synopsis of the topic(s) to be covered, examples of resources to be utilized, and the requirements and expectations to be placed on the students, including a clear method of evaluation.  This proposal shall be signed by the instructor and by the chair of the Major Field (indicating support by the major field), and submitted to the Registrar as soon as possible, but not later than the second week of classes in the semester the tutorial is being offered.  
	\item Like Independent Studies, final approval of tutorials rests with the Academic Standing and Advising Committee.
	\item Tutorials being offered for the second time, or any tutorials to be required as part of a major or minor program, shall be subject to the full peer approval process as any other course.  Once approved by this means no further approval is required for future offerings.  Tutorials being offered for the first time may go through the full approval process, but are not required to do so.
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Grading and Credit}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Tutorials may be graded on a letter grade basis or S/U.
	\item Students may repeat a particular tutorial for credit if the focus of the course is significantly different or if it allows for the refinement and continued development of a skill, e.g., in the performing arts.  
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Experiential Learning}

Any paid internship must be approved by the Faculty sponsor, Faculty coordinator of internships, and the Director of Experiential Learning and Career Services. 

\subsection{Academic Regulations}\label{sec:AcademicRegulations}

\subsubsection{Academic Standing}\label{sub:AcademicStanding}

\paragraph{Class Designation }

Class designation is determined by the number of courses a student has completed satisfactorily: Freshman, 0-29 semester hours; Sophomore, 30-59 semester hours; Junior, 60-89 semester hours; Senior, 90 or more semester hours.

\paragraph{Academic Honors}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Dean's List

		At the end of each semester the Registrar shall prepare a Dean's List of those students who were registered for at least 12 semester hours of letter-graded courses and earned an average of 3.5 or higher for that semester. Courses taken under the exchange agreement with Cornell University shall be included in the GPA calculation for the Dean's List. Students with a grade or I or NR shall not be on the Dean's List. This honor shall be recorded on students' transcripts.

	\item Graduation Honors  

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item Latin Honors. Traditional Latin Honors, \textit{cum laude, magna cum laude, }and \textit{summa cum laude, }are awarded at graduation for excellence in course work throughout the students' college career. The degree of Bachelor of Arts is awarded \textit{cum laude }to those who have a grade point average of 3.50-3.749; \textit{magna cum laude }to those who have a grade point average of 3.75-3.899; and \textit{summa cum laude }to those who have a grade point average of 3.90 and above. All Wells and Wells-affiliated courses are included in these calculations. Latin Honors shall be printed on the student's diploma.
		\item Distinction. The degree shall be awarded \textit{with distinction in the major field }to those students who are recommended for the award by the Faculty in the major field because the students have shown:

			\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
			\item outstanding ability (3.50 average) in major field course work done in the sophomore, junior, and senior years;
			\item the capacity to do independent work with a high degree of initiative, genuine intellectual curiosity, and sense of responsibility-matters to be determined solely by the department which is recommending distinction;
			\item and distinction in the comprehensive evaluation.
			\end{enumerate}

		Acting on departmental recommendations, the Academic Standing and Advising Committee shall transmit names of candidates for distinction to the Faculty.

		\item Graduation honors shall be noted on students' transcripts.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Registrar's List 

		After the close of each semester, the Registrar shall prepare the Registrar's List for the use of the        Committee on Academic Standing and Advising. The Registrar's List shall consist of the names of        students whose cumulative grade point averages are below 2.0.
	
	\item Faculty Review         

		The Committee on Academic Standing and Advising shall review student records after each semester to ascertain if students are achieving a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Students whose cumulative grade point average are below 2.0 shall be so notified by the Dean of the College or by the Dean for Academic Advising.
	
	\item Academic Warning and Academic Probation        

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item The Committee on Academic Standing and Advising shall normally issue an Academic Warning to students whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.0 for the first time. 
		\item The Committee shall normally issue an Academic Probation to students whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.0 for the second time, and a second Academic Probation to any student whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.0 for the third time. 
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Academic Suspension

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item For a student whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.0 for the fourth time, the Committee on Academic Standing and Advising shall normally issue an Academic Suspension for a minimum period of two semesters. In addition, the Committee on Academic Standing and Advising shall consider, at any time, students for suspension who are deemed to have failed to make satisfactory progress toward the degree, for example, students whose cumulative grade point average is below 0.5 after two semesters of study at the College. 
		\item Suspended students must apply for readmission to the Dean of the College, who may set expectations that the students must satisfy prior to or upon return, based on the students' academic progress before suspension. Readmission is at the discretion of the Dean of the College.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Permanent Dismissal for Academic Reasons       

		The Dean of the College or the Committee on Academic Standing and Advising shall permanently dismiss for academic reasons those students return who from an academic suspension and then fail to earn a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 any semester after returning, or who fail to meet other expectations as stipulated by the Dean of the College for readmission from suspension. 
	
	\item Academic Conduct Probation

		The Committee on Academic Standing and Advising may place on Academic Conduct Probation any students who have been found responsible for a conduct code violation and for whom such probation has been recommended by the Community Court. Length of probation will be determined by the Committee upon recommendation of Community Court.
	
	\item College Rights

		The College reserves its legal right to suspend or dismiss students for academic reasons. Faculty, administrators, and trustees shall not be held liable in cases of suspension or dismissal for academic reasons.
	
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Course Grades}\label{sub:CourseGrades}

\paragraph{The Grading Scales}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Letter Grades

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item In recording and reporting grades, the letters of the alphabet shall be used in such manner that A+ shall represent 97-100; A, 93-96; A-, 90-92; B+, 87-89; B, 83-86; B-, 80-82; C+, 77-79; C, 73-76; C-, 70-72; D+, 67-69; D, 63-66; D-, 60-62; F, 59 and below. 
		\item The lowest passing grade shall be D-. 
		\item For the computation of academic standing, a grade-point system is used. In this system A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0, with an increase of 0.3 for each plus, and a decrease of 0.3 for each minus attached to a letter grade above F. 
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item At the discretion of the instructor, courses may be graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U), but must be so designated in the catalog description of the course. If students take more than two courses so graded in one semester, the additional course or courses shall be considered as courses taken under the pass or fail option (see below). Courses graded S or U may be used to satisfy the requirements of a student's major or minor field(s).
		\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of S shall be disregarded by the Registrar and all grades of U shall have the numerical equivalent of 0.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Credit or Fail

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item All internships shall be graded Credit (Cr) or Fail (F). 
		\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of Cr shall be disregarded by the Registrar and all grades of F shall have the numerical equivalent of 0. 
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Pass with Distinction, Satisfactory, or Fail

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item The Senior Comprehensive Evaluation shall be graded Pass with Distinction (PD), Satisfactory (S), or Fail (F). 
		\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of S shall be disregarded by the Registrar while the grades of PD and F shall have the numerical equivalents of 4.0 and 0, respectively.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Election of Courses for Pass or Fail

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item At the time of registration, or within the first week of classes of either semester, students may designate courses that are normally graded on a letter scale to be graded Pass or Fail. A freshman may elect one course on a pass or fail basis, but only in the Spring Semester. A sophomore, junior, or senior may elect up to one course per semester for which a grade of Pass or Fail may be earned. 
		\item The following regulations apply:

			\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelC,ref=\itemRefC]
			\item After the first week of classes in either semester, students must petition the Dean of the College to change the basis of grading a course, either from a letter grade to a grade of pass or fail, or from a grade of pass or fail to a letter grade. After the sixth week of classes, such petitions shall be approved only in unusual circumstances, such as when there are medical reasons. 
			\item Courses so chosen shall not be in a student's major field. 
			\item One course so chosen may be used to satisfy the requirements of the minor field, but only at the 100-level. 
			\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of P shall be disregarded by the Registrar and all grades of F shall have the numerical equivalent of 0. 
			\end{enumerate}
	
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item The Grade of Incomplete

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item Under extraordinary circumstances an instructor may assign a grade of I (Incomplete) if a student is unable to complete the work of a course on schedule but will be able to complete it at a later date without further class attendance. The extraordinary circumstances must be beyond the student's control (e.g., reasons of health or severe personal contingencies), and they must be documentable. The need for the Incomplete must have become apparent within the last three weeks of classes of a semester, and the student must have been passing the course at that time.
		\item The student must file the incomplete grade request and contract form with the Registrar by the last day of classes. Both the student and the instructor must sign the contract. The incomplete grade request and contract form shall specify the requirements yet to be completed and the deadline for completion (no later than the end of the eighth week of the subsequent semester). The form shall also specify what the grade shall be if the work is not completed. If a contract is not submitted, the instructor may not assign an incomplete but shall assign the grade that the student would earn without completing the remaining work for the course.
		\item The Registrar shall send the instructor a reminder of the incomplete on the due date specified on the form. If the student has completed the work, the instructor shall duly submit the final grade to the Registrar within 5 days of the date specified on the form. If a student does not complete the work by the specified deadline, the instructor may change the ``I'' to the grade indicated on the form, or, if circumstances warrant it, the instructor may extend the deadline for the incomplete, but no later than the end of the semester after the incomplete was granted. If the Registrar does not receive either a grade or written notification of an extension by 5 days after the reminder, the Registrar shall record the grade indicated on the form. If no grade is indicated, the Registrar shall record a grade of ``F*'' (to indicate an administrative assignment of a failing grade).
		\item If a grade is submitted to replace an ``I'' after the grade report is delivered to the student, the Registrar shall note the date of the removal of the incomplete on the student's transcript. Until the Registrar shall have substituted a new grade, the ``I'' shall remain on the transcript.
		\item Students with pending grades of ``I'' shall not be allowed to participate in internships or off-campus study programs in the subsequent semester.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Administrative Assignment of a Failing Grade

		If the Registrar does not receive a grade or an incomplete grade request and contract form in lieu of a grade, the Registrar shall assign a grade of F* for the course. Such assignments shall be made only with approval of the Dean of the College.

	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Determination of Grades}\label{par:DeterminationOfGrades}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Criteria

		The grade of A indicates work of the highest quality; such work will generally be characterized not only by accuracy but also by excellence in such qualities as comprehensiveness, insight, and originality. The grade of B indicates work of good quality; such work will often show some of the qualities that characterize A work. The grade of C indicates work of average quality; such work will generally be reasonably accurate, but may show only limited comprehensiveness, insight, and originality. The grade of D indicates work that is below average in quality but yet acceptable; such work may be unsatisfactory in certain respects, but will be satisfactory in others. The grade of F indicates work that is unsatisfactory.
	
	\item Conspicuous Failure

		In case of a conspicuous failure in a final examination, when the student, in the opinion of the instructor, fails to show anything like a satisfactory comprehension of the subject, the student may be marked as failing the course even though the numerical value of the class work would yield a grade of D-.
	
	\item Report of Grades \label{item:ReportOfGrades}

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item At the end of the first seven weeks of each semester, instructors shall report to the Registrar the grades of all new students, and grades of C- or below for any other student.
		\item  In each semester, final grades shall be submitted  to the Registrar within five days following the course examination. Grades for courses without a final examination are due within five days after the end of the examination period. Final grades for Seniors in the Spring Semester shall be reported to the Registrar at the time specified.
		\item  The Registrar shall notify the students, academic advisors, and appropriate administrators of all grades reported, including Incomplete. 
		\item  If an instructor wishes to change a recorded grade,  a written request for the change shall be submitted to the Dean of the College. Except under extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Dean, grades shall be changed only through the eighth week of the subsequent semester and only because of the instructor's corrected calculation of the grade or because of the instructor's decision to consider ``lost'' work submitted by the student. Upon approval by the Dean, the change shall be recorded by the Registrar. The Registrar shall notify the student, in writing, within two weeks of the change of the recorded grade.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Examinations}

\paragraph{Final Examinations}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
	\item General Regulations

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item Each instructor shall hold a three-hour examination at the end of each course at the time indicated in the published schedule, except as noted below (Substitutions). The final examination in a  course shall normally count one-third and the work up to the final examination two-thirds of the grade given a student at the close of a course. No instructor is permitted to close a course of study or hold a final examination before the appointed time except that, at the discretion of the instructor, (a) student(s) may take the examination at a time other than that at which the rest of the students in the course are taking it.
		\item  In courses in which papers are part of the work, but in which there is also a final examination or substitute therefore, instructors may not set a time for submitting papers any later than 4:30 p.m. on the day immediately following the last day of classes.
		\item  Final examinations shall be returned to the students upon request. Examinations that are not returned shall be kept on file by the instructor for a period of at least one year.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Substitutions for Final Examinations

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item An instructor may substitute in any course a form of evaluation other than examination, provided that notification of such intention shall be given to the Registrar, at the time specified. The Registrar's records of such substitutions may be reviewed by the Curriculum Committee.
		\item Papers and projects assigned in lieu of a final examination shall be due no later than the conclusion of the last scheduled examination.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Rules Governing Examinations

		\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
		\item Students are expected to govern themselves in examinations, as elsewhere, according to the rules and regulations of the Collegiate Association.
		\item Students who find it necessary to take an examination \textit{in absentia} shall be responsible for making necessary arrangements in consultation with the instructor. If the instructor requests, the students shall specify the time and place the examination will be given and/or the name, address and telephone number of an individual who will administer the examination.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Comprehensive Evaluation}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item The Requirement

		A comprehensive evaluation is required of each Senior, except that a candidate in a Dual Degree Program may schedule the evaluation in other than the senior year. Some or all of the work upon which the evaluation is based shall not carry course credit, but shall be in addition to the normal course load.

	\item Consultation with Students

		In consultation with its  majors and with the approval of the Curriculum Committee, each department or programmatic area shall  set forth the means by which students then in the junior class shall meet the goal of comprehensive evaluation.
	
	\item Report of Grades

		Each department or programmatic area shall submit to the Registrar a grade of Pass with Distinction, Satisfactory, or Fail for each student. The Faculty shall report to each student the result of the comprehensive evaluation.
	
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Calculation of Averages}

The calculation of a student's grade point average shall be based on all the Wells courses and Wells-affiliated courses undertaken following  initial matriculation at Wells College, with these exceptions:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
	\item Courses in which a grade of PD, P, Cr or S has been earned shall be handled as noted in \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningStudentStatus}, \cref{sec:AcademicRegulations}.\labelcref{sub:CourseGrades}.
	\item Students may repeat only courses for which they have previously earned a grade  of ``F'' (or ``U''), or courses that are designated ``repeatable.'' In the case of a course not designated ``repeatable,'' and for which the student received a grade of ``F'' or ``U,'' after the repeat both grades shall be posted on the transcript and be included in the respective semester grade point averages. However, only the higher grade earned shall be calculated into the cumulative grade point average. In the case of a course designated ``repeatable,'' every grade earned shall be posted on the transcript and be calculated into the semester and cumulative grade point averages. This is true even when a grade of ``F'' or ``U'' is received.
	\item Courses taken at other institutions, except in Wells-affiliated programs, shall not be included in the calculation of the grade point average as a matter of normal practice.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Records}

\paragraph{Instructor's Records}

Each instructor shall keep a record of graded work of the students in each of their courses for at least three years.

\paragraph{Registrar's Records}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
	\item Course Records

		\item Students may seek correction or deletion of records which they feel are inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their rights. Students shall initiate such action by consulting the Dean of the College for records concerning academic matters or the Dean of Students for records concerning non-academic matters.
		\item Information from the records of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes may be released to the parents without the students' consent. Unless students have filed a notification of financial independence and supporting evidence of that independence with the Dean of Students, they will be assumed to be dependent.
		\item College instructors and officials of Wells who have a legitimate educational reason for reviewing students' records will have access to those records.

\subsection{Absences}

\subsubsection{General Regulations}

It is the general policy of the College that class attendance is expected, but instructors have the right and the obligation to set their own policies regarding absences.

\subsubsection{Work Missed Because of Absence}

\paragraph{Responsibility}
It is the responsibility of students who are absent from classes because of illness or family emergency to arrange to make up missed work. The Dean of Students shall notify Faculty about students who have been admitted to a healthcare facility or who must unexpectedly leave the campus for reasons of illness or family emergency, and shall request the cooperation of the Faculty.

\paragraph{Deadlines}
Where permission to complete missed or late work has been granted by the Faculty member, the Faculty member shall set a deadline for the completion of the work and shall determine whether or not a penalty is to be exacted for lateness. Once the deadline has been set, no further extensions save for exceptional circumstances shall be allowed and the student alone will be responsible for seeing to it that all obligations are fulfilled as stipulated. In no case may deadlines be set beyond the times specified in the Manual for turning in grades to the Registrar (see \cref{art:RegulationsConcerningStudentStatus}, \cref{sec:AcademicRegulations}.\labelcref{sub:CourseGrades}.\labelcref{par:DeterminationOfGrades}.\labelcref{item:ReportOfGrades}).

\paragraph{Honor Suspension}
A student suspended for violation of the Honor Code, found in the \constitution, shall not receive credit for any enrolled courses during the semester for which the suspension is imposed.

\subsubsection{Leaves of Absence}

\paragraph{Granting} 

A leave of absence shall be granted to students who must be absent during the semester but anticipate returning to complete the course work. A leave of absence for medical or other personal reasons may be granted by the Dean of Students for a maximum of 15 days; only one such leave may be granted during a 12-month period. When students initiate the leave of absence, the Dean of Students Office shall notify the academic advisor and the Faculty in whose courses the students are registered.

\paragraph{Consequence of Not Returning}

A student who does not return from the approved leave of absence shall be withdrawn from the College as of the last documentable date of attendance in class (see below).

\subsubsection{Withdrawal from the College}\label{sub:WithdrawlFromTheCollege}

\paragraph{Procedure}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item Students wishing to withdraw from the College before the completion of a semester are required to comply with the withdrawal procedure. This process is initiated with the Dean of Students and requires completion of the withdrawal form. Students may not withdraw after the last day of classes. When students have officially withdrawn, the Dean of Students Office will notify the academic advisor and the Faculty in whose courses the students were registered.
	\item Students who are completing the current semester but are not intending to return to Wells for the next semester shall also complete a withdrawal form and indicate the reasons for leaving the College.
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Grading Policy}

When students withdraw from the College, the transcript shall read as follows:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item Before the first day of classes, no record is entered.
	\item From the first class day through the official withdrawal period, the registrar will assign a ``W'' for each course.
	\item After the official withdrawal period, students who withdraw from the College shall  receive grades of W for courses they were passing at the time of withdrawal, and grades of WF for any courses they were failing at the time of withdrawal, except in cases in which, by the judgment of the Dean of the College, the withdrawal was in effect required for medical or other grave personal reasons. In such cases, the Registrar shall record W.
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Readmission}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item A student in good standing who withdraws from the College shall be readmitted by the Dean of Students. A physician's report may be required for readmission of students granted an extended leave for medical reasons.
	\item Students who are suspended from the College for academic reasons may be readmitted by the Dean of the College.
	\item Students who are suspended from the College for non-academic reasons may be readmitted by the Dean of Students.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Approved Off-Campus Study}
Students studying off-campus are participating in one of the following options.

\paragraph{Wells College Programs}
Wells College Programs are administered by Wells College. Students are registered full-time through the college; thus, Wells College can certify enrollment.

\paragraph{Affiliated Programs}
Affiliated Programs have been reviewed and approved by the Wells College Faculty, but Wells does not directly administer the programs. Students are registered full-time through the college; thus, Wells College can certify enrollment.

\paragraph{Field Experience}
Field Experience is an approved semester-long internship or independent study experience. Students register for such an experience through the college; thus, Wells College can certify enrollment according to the number of semester hours for which the student is registered.

\paragraph{Non-Affiliated Programs}
Non-Affiliated Programs are administered by other institutions and have not been reviewed or approved by the Wells College Faculty. Students are registered at the offering institution and not at Wells College; thus Wells College cannot certify enrollment. 

\subsection{Special (Non-Traditional) Students}\label{sec:NonTraditionalStudents}

\subsubsection{Definition}

Individuals who wish to enroll in courses on a course-by-course or semester-by-semester basis may do so for up to 32 credit hours as a special student. Upon completion of 32 semester hours, special students must either request permission from the Dean of the College to continue, or may apply to the College for admission into a degree program. Special students may enroll in classes on a space available basis only.
