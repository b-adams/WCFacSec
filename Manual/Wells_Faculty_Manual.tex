%ARTICLE VI. INDEPENDENT STUDY AND TUTORIALS
\subsection{Independent Study, Tutorials, and Experiential Learning}\label{sec:IndependentStudyAndTutorials}

%A.
\subsubsection{Independent Study}

\paragraph{Purpose}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
\item Independent Study is an option for those students who have demonstrated an ability to\modified{5/13/93} work without close supervision. 

\item The purpose of Independent Study is to supplement the more structured methods of regular courses with the opportunity for students of high initiative and responsibility to apply their abilities to new material with a minimum of guidance. 

\item While there are no formal course prerequisites for such work, it is the normal expectation that independent projects shall involve explorations in depth of some prior work, or work for which the students have special non-academic background that qualifies them\modified{10/10/89} for the study proposed. Exceptions may be made in cases where students of generally demonstrated capability wish to do exploratory work in a field in which they have little or no background, in a manner not provided for by the regular curriculum. 

\item Independent\modified{5/12/98} study normally is conducted at the 300 level as XXX 399 and may be for one to three semester hours of credit. Under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the instructor, preferably in the summer or the January Intersession, students may undertake independent study with the designation XXX 199 or XXX 299, to indicate that the work is not at a level sufficiently advanced to warrant a 300-level designation.

\item In cases of irreconcilable schedule conflicts, a course from the regular curriculum may be taken as an independent study, either with the designation, 199/299/399, or with the regular course number, followed by ``I'', at the discretion of the instructor.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Approval}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
\item Qualified Sophomores, Juniors or Seniors may pursue one Independent Study Project during any semester. Exceptionally able and responsible students may pursue such work outside the academic semester. Under exceptional circumstances first year students may be permitted by petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and Advising to pursue an Independent Study Project after their first semester, either over January or in the Spring Semester.

\item Students who have a plan for Independent Study should consult with the instructor under whose guidance the work is proposed. If the instructor approves the project, a brief description of the project and the amount of credit proposed for it, approved by the instructor and advisor, must be submitted on the Independent Study Form available through the Registrar's Office during the registration period preceding the semester in which the work is to be conducted. 

\item Final approval of all projects rests with the Academic Standing and Advising Committee; copies of the proposal shall be distributed to the instructor, advisor, and student upon approval or disapproval. Students should not assume approval until formally so notified.
\end{enumerate}

%B.
\subsubsection{Tutorials}

\paragraph{Purpose}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
\item Tutorials offer a means for in depth study of material or a topic not otherwise covered in the curriculum.  

\item Tutorials are normally for one semester hour and normally involve a small group of students meeting together with a Faculty member for one hour per week.  Tutorials thus offer a flexible mechanism for providing instruction on topics that may arise via student request, to meet special or last minute curricular needs, and/or for skill development (such as in the performing arts).                                                                                                                     
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Approval }
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
\item In the case where a tutorial is offered for the first time, the instructor shall submit a Tutorial Proposal Form that shall include a description of the course, a synopsis of the topic(s) to be covered, examples of resources to be utilized, and the requirements and expectations to be placed on the students, including a clear method of evaluation.  This proposal shall be signed by the instructor and by the chair of the Major Field (indicating support by the major field), and submitted to the Registrar as soon as possible, but not later than the second week of classes in the semester the tutorial is being offered.  

\item Like Independent Studies, final approval of tutorials rests with the Academic Standing and Advising Committee.

\item Tutorials being offered for the second time, or any tutorials to be required as part of a major or minor program, shall be subject to the full peer approval process as any other course.  Once approved by this means no further approval is required for future offerings.  Tutorials being offered for the first time may go through the full approval process, but are not required to do so.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Grading and Credit}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
\item Tutorials may be graded on a letter grade basis or S/U.

\item Students may repeat a particular tutorial for credit if the focus of the course is significantly different or if it allows for the refinement and continued development of a skill, e.g., in the performing arts.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Experiential Learning}

Any paid internship must be approved by the Faculty sponsor, Faculty coordinator of internships, and the Director of Experiential Learning and Career Services.

\subsubsection{Course Grades}\label{sub:CourseGrades}

%A.
\paragraph{The Grading Scales}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
%1.
\item Letter Grades
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
\item In recording and reporting grades, the letters of the alphabet shall be used in such manner that A+ shall represent 97-100; A, 93-96; A-, 90-92; B+, 87-89; B, 83-86; B-, 80-82; C+, 77-79; C, 73-76; C-, 70-72; D+, 67-69; D, 63-66; D-, 60-62; F, 59 and below. 

\item The lowest passing grade shall be D-. 

\item For the computation of academic standing\modified{5/17/89}, a grade-point system is used. In this system A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0, with an increase of 0.3 for each plus, and a decrease of 0.3 for each minus attached to a letter grade above F. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
\item At the discretion of the instructor, courses may be graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U), but must be so designated in the catalog description of the course. If students take more than two courses so graded in one semester, the additional course or courses shall be considered as courses taken under the pass or fail option (see below). Courses graded S or U may be used to satisfy the requirements of a student's major or minor field(s).

\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of S shall be disregarded by the Registrar and all grades of U shall have the numerical equivalent of 0.
\end{enumerate}

\item Credit or Fail
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]

\item All internships shall be graded Credit (Cr) or Fail (F). 

\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of Cr shall be disregarded by the Registrar and all grades of F shall have the numerical equivalent of 0. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Pass with Distinction, Satisfactory, or Fail
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]

\end{enumerate}

\item Election of Courses for Pass or Fail
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]

\item At the time of registration, or within the first week of classes of either semester, students may designate courses that are normally graded on a letter scale to be graded Pass or Fail. A freshman may elect one course on a pass or fail basis, but only in the Spring Semester. A sophomore, junior, or senior may elect up to one course per semester for which a grade of Pass or Fail may be earned. 

\item The following regulations apply:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelC,ref=\itemRefC]
\item After the first week of classes in either semester, students must petition the Dean of the College to change the basis of grading a course, either from a letter grade to a grade of pass or fail, or from a grade of pass or fail to a letter grade. After the sixth week of classes, such petitions shall be approved only in unusual circumstances, such as when there are medical reasons. 

\item Courses so chosen shall not be in a student's major field. 

\item One course so chosen may be used to satisfy the requirements of the minor field, but only at the 100-level. 

\item In the computation of grade point averages, all grades of P shall be disregarded by the Registrar and all grades of F shall have the numerical equivalent of 0. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
%2.
\item The Grade of Incomplete

\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelB,ref=\itemRefB]
\item Under extraordinary circumstances \modified{5/17/89}an instructor may assign a grade of I (Incomplete) if a student is unable to complete the work of a course on schedule but will be able to complete it at a later date without further class attendance. The extraordinary circumstances must be beyond the student's control (e.g., reasons of health or severe personal contingencies), and they must be documentable. The need for the Incomplete must have become apparent within the last three weeks of classes of a semester, and the student must have been passing the course at that time.

\item The student must file the incomplete grade \modified{4/9/96}request and contract form with the Registrar by the last day of classes. Both the student and the instructor must sign the contract. The incomplete grade request and contract form shall specify the requirements yet to be completed and the deadline for completion (no later than the end of the eighth week of the subsequent semester). The form shall also specify what the grade shall be if the work is not completed. If a contract is not submitted, the instructor may not assign an incomplete but shall assign the grade that the student would earn without completing the remaining work for the course.

\oldbreak{VII-4}

\item The Registrar shall send the instructor a reminder of the incomplete on the due date specified on the form. If the student has completed the work, the instructor shall duly submit the final grade to the Registrar within 5 days of the date specified on the form. If a student does not complete the work by the specified deadline, the instructor may change the ``I'' to the grade indicated on the form, or, if circumstances warrant it, the instructor may extend the deadline for the incomplete, but no later than the end of the semester after the incomplete was granted. If the Registrar does not receive either a grade or written notification of an extension by 5 days after the reminder, the Registrar shall record the grade indicated on the form. If no grade is indicated, the Registrar shall record a grade of ``F*'' (to indicate an administrative assignment of a failing grade).

\item If a grade is submitted to replace an “I” after the grade report is delivered to the student, the Registrar shall note the date of the removal of the incomplete on the student's transcript. Until the Registrar shall have substituted a new grade, the “I” shall remain on the transcript.

\item Students with pending grades of ``I'' shall not be allowed to participate in internships or off-campus study programs in the subsequent semester.
\end{enumerate}
%3. 
\item Administrative Assignment of a Failing Grade

If the Registrar does not receive a grade or an incomplete grade request and contract form in lieu of a grade, the Registrar shall assign a grade of F* for the course. Such assignments shall be made only with approval of the Dean of the College.

\paragraph{Determination of Grades}\label{par:DeterminationOfGrades}



\begin{enumerate}[label=\itemLevelA,ref=\itemRefA]
%1.
\item Criteria

The grade of A indicates work of the highest quality; such work will generally be characterized not only by accuracy but also by excellence in such qualities as comprehensiveness, insight, and originality. The grade of B indicates work of good quality; such work will often show some of the qualities that characterize A work. The grade of C indicates work of average quality; such work will generally be reasonably accurate, but may show only limited comprehensiveness, insight, and originality. The grade of D indicates work that is below average in quality but yet acceptable; such work may be unsatisfactory in certain respects, but will be satisfactory in others. The grade of F indicates work that is unsatisfactory.

%2.
\item Conspicuous Failure

In case of a conspicuous failure in a final examination, when the student, in the opinion of the instructor, fails to show anything like a satisfactory comprehension of the subject, the student may be marked as failing the course even though the numerical value of the class work would yield a grade of D-.
